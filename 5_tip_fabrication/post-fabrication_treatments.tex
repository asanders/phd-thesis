\subsection{Improving the Fabrication Success Rate - Resetting Tips}

To improve on the number of successfully fabricated tips, a reset procedure is required to reset failed fabrications to their original state. Since the base structure for fabrication is Pt, submersion in aqua regia is a viable method to remove Au growths. Aqua regia solution (3:1 \ce{HCl}:\ce{HNO3}) is typically used to dissolve Au and is a noted method for cleaning Pt electrodes for use in electrochemical cells \cite{ElectrochemistryForChemists}. Submersion for even a few seconds is enough to remove all Au.

Since tips are typically imaged in SEM to determine if the quality of fabrication is satisfactory samples are likely to be coated in a thin layer of carbon. Tips are submerged in piranha solution to remove organic layers and expose the Au before aqua regia treatment.
