%\chapter{Experimental Procedures}

The previously described test rig is fully automated to allow for a wide variety of experiments to be performed. All experiments are ran using a custom Python application. Using this application, the microscope is capable of finely controlling mounted samples with nm-scale precision, quickly acquiring 3d image volumes at each wavelength using the spectrometers and dynamically measuring the physical response of two opposing objects as they move relative to each other. The following chapter describes the procedures applied to the study of tip plasmonics as tips are characterised, aligned and then dynamically scanned to understand the underlying plasmonics.
