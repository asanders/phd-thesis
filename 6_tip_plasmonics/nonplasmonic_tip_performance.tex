\section{Non-Plasmonic Performance of Spherical Au Nanoparticle Tips}

% Spherical Au tips in tip alignment
The conductive Au-coating on the spherical tips means they can be used both with the capacitive tip alignment technique and also for measuring current through a tip dimer nano-gap.

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption[Comparison of alignment scans using sharp Au tips and spherical Au tips]{\textbf{Comparison of alignment scans using sharp Au tips and spherical Au tips.} The width of the peak in the alignment scans is limited to the apex diameter. The peak width when aligning spherical Au tips is therefore much larger than when aligning sharp Au tips.}

% Fabricated tips in tip alignment 
Fabricated AuNP-on-Pt tips perform similarly to vacuum-processed spherical Au tips during tip alignment using scanning capacitance microscopy. As the AuNP is grown directly onto the Pt the spherical apex remains highly conductive. A high conductivity is ensured during experiments by cleaning the tips prior to use to remove any insulating surface contaminants.
